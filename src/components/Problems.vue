        Infrared camera doesnâ€™t work without infrared illumination
        <ul>
          <li>First, I tried using a single 850nm infrared LED</li>
          <li>
            It wasn't bright enough, so I disassembled an infrared floodlight used by scientists for nocturnal research</li>
          <li>I had to rewire the power supply to run off small batteries, remove the lenses and disable the ambient light sensor</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Soldering wires to wires is harder than soldering to PCB
<ul>
  <li>
    Folks taught me that applying solder and flux to both wires first, applying heatshrink, then twisting them together and soldering is the way to go

        Difficulty connecting to the pi after taking it out of the water
        <ul>
          <li>It appears that when I had connected the infrared light to the 5V out on the Pi board, it was drawing a high amount of current (1.8 amps)</li>
          <li>The Pi itself draws around 80 mA, and the battery provides around 2.1 A at peak capacity</li>
          <li>Solution was to use a separate battery pack for the light. This </li>

        Running out of space on small sd card (908M of 8gigs left after OS)
        <ul>
          <li>Set compression setting to lower so each file takes up less space</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        It gets really hot
        <ul>

            Should be fine in the water :)
